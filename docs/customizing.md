# Customizing

**Build Cross Check** is designed as a shortcut to allow anyone to create a [Check Run](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/) from their build process. Check Runs are always created with a status of Completed.

## Schema

The data structure and rules mimic the [Create Check Run](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/runs/#create-a-check-run) operation in the GitHub Api.

### CreateCheckRun <sub><sup>[src](https://github.com/justaprogrammer/BCC-Core/blob/master/src/BCC.Core/Model/CheckRunSubmission/CreateCheckRun.cs)</sup></sub>

+ name (string, required) - The name of the Check Run

### Annotation <sub><sup>[src](https://github.com/justaprogrammer/BCC-Core/blob/master/src/BCC.Core/Model/CheckRunSubmission/Annotation.cs)</sup></sub>

### CheckRunImage <sub><sup>[src](https://github.com/justaprogrammer/BCC-Core/blob/master/src/BCC.Core/Model/CheckRunSubmission/CheckRunImage.cs)</sup></sub>
